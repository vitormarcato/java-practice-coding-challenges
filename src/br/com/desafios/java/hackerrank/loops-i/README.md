# Java Loops I - Challenge from Hacker Rank

This is my solution using Java for Hacker Rank Challenge: Loops I

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math.

**Task**

Given an integer, N, print its first 10 multiples. Each multiple Nx i  (where 1<= i <= 10) should be printed on a new line in the form: N x i = result.

**Input Format**
A single, N.

**Constraints**
2<=N<=20

**Output Format**
Print 10 lines of output; each line i (where 1<=i<=10 ) contains the result of N x i  in the form:
N x i = result.


**Sample Input**

```bash
2
```

**Sample Output**

```bash
2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
2 x 3 = 6
2 x 4 = 8
2 x 5 = 10
2 x 6 = 12
2 x 7 = 14
2 x 8 = 16
2 x 9 = 18
2 x 10 = 20

```
