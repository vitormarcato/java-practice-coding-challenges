# Java If-Else - Challenge from Hacker Rank

In this challenge, we test your knowledge of using if-else conditional statements to automate decision-making processes. An if-else statement has the following logical flow:

### Task
Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:

If N is odd, print **Weird**
If N is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print **Not Weird**
If N is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print **Weird**
If N is even and greater than , print **Not Weird**

Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not  is weird.

### Input Format

A single line containing a positive integer, N.

### Constraints

1 <= N >= 100

### Output Format

Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.

**Sample Input 0**

```
3
```

**Sample Output 0**

 ```
 Weird
```

**Sample Input 1**

```
24
```

**Sample Output 1** 

```
Not Weird
```

### Explanation

Sample Case 0:
is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.

Sample Case 1:
and  is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.
